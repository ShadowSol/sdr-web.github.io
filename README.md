# weppi-sdr
A web-based interface for Software Defined Radio real time analysis

## Goals
- Real time spectrum visualization
- Frequency banwith control
- Modulation/demodulation (FM, AM, etc) We'll mostly have the raspberry Pi be more of a proxy, we'll let better specced out hardware or virtualized hardware to handle the flow of data
- Audio streaming
- Accessible device interface and ease of use
- Waterfall display
- dynamic waterfalls! We'll get an LLM to maybe transcrive it!
- figure out a solution to the bandwith problem

### 26.02.2025 - teams meeting
we met and talked out our project plan and set out our goals and made the project goal clear on paper. We talked about the resources we need such as the RTL SDR usb combo from rxtx store online. approximately 65 euros. not bad.
